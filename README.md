# Handwriting Analysis using Graphology and Machine Learning

Handwriting Analysis is the study of handwriting, especially when employed as a means of analyzing character. Deep learning has been widely used to recognize handwriting. In offline handwriting recognition, text is analysed after being written. Information, such as pen stroke, pressure and speed of writing are analysed. It is particularly necessary for historical documents, archives, or mass digitization of hand-filled forms. It is generally considered a pseudoscience. 

Handwriting also termed as brain-writing is a useful measure in identifying the characteristic personality traits of an individual. It is well suited to cognitive psychology as handwriting relies upon the same principles as cognitive psychology. Everything that is part of the brain is expressed in many ways, one way being handwriting; hence it is called as ‘brain writing’. Thus, brain print is left on the paper. What is written at the moment is an instant photo of how the person thinks, feels and behaves. In other words, brain or subconscious mind actually forms the characters as a result of habit.  Handwriting analysts also known as graphologists can examine an individual’s handwriting to predict the personality traits of the writer. Automated handwriting analysis can be used to examine personal traits of candidates during interviews accurately as the accuracy of an analyst highly depends on his skill set. Also hiring a graphologist to analyze hundreds of samples for recruitment purpose will be time consuming and not be feasible economically.
This work discusses about a method for analysing real world handwritten text samples with the aid of technology. The analysis is done for specific features of the sample for determining various characteristic behavioral traits of the person. Various parameters of the handwritten sample like Margin, Baseline, T-bar and Slant will be taken into consideration to determine corresponding traits. 

## Requirements

1- Node.js and npm

2- http-server

3- numpy

4- matplotlib

5- scikit-learn

6- keras

7- tensorflow

8- tensorflow js

9- tesseract js

10- OpenCV

## Steps to run the project

1- Extract the zip file and save it in the drive in which node js is installed (preferably C drive)

2- Now inside the project folder, type the following commands:

(i)- npm install

(ii)- npm install http-server

3- Now open a fresh cmd

4- Copy the address of the Web folder in the main folder

5- Type: http-server ......[/Web]......

6- It will start the localhost server and the website will open and ml models will be deployed.

7- Since model.json is also present in the folder, so no need to train the model again. You can run the project directly by following the above steps.
